           <h1>About me</h1>
           <br>
           <p>Hello there! As i already said i am Maja Tankoska, an aspired software engineer student from Skopje, Macedonia born on 25th April 2003. Right now i am studying my bachelor's degree at FINKI
           Faculty of Computer science and Engineering. I would love to get my master's on this subject but there is lot of time till then since i am in my first year right now.
           I have also been getting few courses about HTML, CSS and JavaScript to learn more about FrontEnd development.</p>
           <p>Beside computer sciences i am really interested and trying to learn more about finances and investing. Since in my free time i enjoy reading books, i mix these two interests and read about finances and success.
               My favourite book is definitely "Rich dad poor dad" from Robert Kiyosaki. Highly recommend it.</p>
           <p>One of my favourite things to do when i want to relax is watching spanish TV shows especially thrilers. I enjoy the most in this because while i enjoy watching my favourite genre in movies i also learn new language.
           I learn Spanish just by watching it on TV but i think that i am pretty good at it so far. Maybe would take some course or private lessons about that too. Beside Spanish i also know English almost like Macedonian my native language. I know Serbian as well and little bit German.</p>
           <p>As you can see i have few interests but aside them i like spending time with my friends, family and my dog. They always support me and make me laugh, i love having them in my life.
           As for my future i first of all plan on finishing my university education and then would love to work for myself, something that will mix my creativity and intelligence but we will see how it will turn out.</p>
